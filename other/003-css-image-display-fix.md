# CSS Image DIsplay Fix

You might or might not have noticed this, but when you inspect images on a webpage using your Dev Tools, there's a small line underneath them, unless this was "fixed" by the developer.

This is not really a bug. It happens because images are inline elements, and once you look at the image below, you'll begin getting the sense.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/baseline.jpg">
</div>

The green line is the **baseline**, an invisble line on which elements "sit". As you can see, some characters in the word `paragraph` go beyond this line, creating the red line you're seeing. And since images are inline elements, they "sit" on the baseline relative to elements before or after them, leaving a whitespace between their base and the space created by characters going beyond the baseline.

To avoid this, just give the images a `display: 'block';`

```html
img {
   display: block;
}
```

There, done! Now all images on your page won't have that annoying whitespace as they will fill it up.
