# CSS Responsive Fonts

Making sure your fonts adapt to different screen layouts is very important. To help us with this, we often use **rem** units, which are fluid. **REM** stands for *root em*. **1rem** = the root font size, i.e. the default font size of the browser, or the one the user sets. On most browsers, the default font size is **16px**, so **1rem** would equal **16px**.

You can manually set the root font size like this:

```css
html {
   font-size: 10px; /* You can put your desired default font size */
}
```

Therefore, **rem** all font sizes will refer to the 10px. So 

```css
p {
   font-size: 1rem; /* 1rem = 1 x 10px = 10px*/
}

h1 {
   font-size: 2rem; /* 2rem = 2 x 10px = 20px */
}
```

Doing this makes the fonts respond to whatever font size is the default or is set by the use. It is much better the using non-fluid units like PXs.
