If you are looking for a programming language to handle the entire chain of creation of an application, both the client side (frontend) and the server side, database and other parts of the backend, javascript could be the best option.

My name is Ronald, I am a FullStack developer that means I take care of both sides: the back and the front side. With JavaScript I can manage the front through native Javascript or through Frameworks such as React.js,  Vue.js, or Angular. Of course you need to know HTML and CSS, two basic and easy languages ​​to learn before mastering JavaScript.

On the back side I use Node.js (especially the framework: Express) to manage the server and the API's, I also like to use MongoDB as a database since the language is also Javascript. If you need more tools such as a Docker container or a cloud deployment with AWS and monitoring on production with PM2, you would still be comfortable since the language is still similar to working with JavaScript.

Another advantage of Javascript is that it is a language that is relatively easy to learn, with which you can learn to master the front and the back in a few years. Something that with other back-end languages ​​like Java would take a little longer.

In conclusion, if you are looking for a programming language with which to comfortably handle the entire fabric of an application, JavaScript is surely a very good choice. :+1:
