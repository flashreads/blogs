# Why a Website?

Hear a new term, and we all reach out for our phones to Google it up. Something similar happens with Startup websites as well. In the world of digitization, a business is lost if it doesnâ€™t have a website. Web development is a blossoming sphere of coding that is gaining popularity quickly. An efficient website lies at the core of a successful business. It is also representative of the basic ideals and ethics of the founders.

1. A website not only helps you connect with customers from across the globe, but also helps you gather multiple perspectives and feedback, and increase the flexibility and inclusivity of your product or service. 
2. An innovative website gives you an edge over the others while looking for investors. A user friendly webpage will also attract potential employees and customers for future business. 
3. A business website is an online shop front to show your brand among new customers and all that you provide and offer.  Having a website will promote your organization for little money. 
4. Long term clients are every organisation's support and advocate the fact that it is running smoothly. Sound websites often help businesses gather long term clients. 
5. A well designed website will rank higher up in the search results and will witness more views, this improving sales. 
6. It is a blank canvas where you can show your credibility, brand awareness and to showcase your seriousness on your business.
