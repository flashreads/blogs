3.1.1) Definition: -
Network scanning is a procedure for identifying active devices on a network by employing a feature or features in the network protocol to signal devices and await a response. During a network scan, all the active devices on the network send signals, and once the response is received, the scanner evaluates the results and checks to see if there are inconsistencies.


3.1.2) Purpose of Network Scanning: -
Network scanning is mainly used for security assessment, system maintenance, and also for performing attacks by hackers.
The purpose of network scanning is as follows:

•	Recognize available UDP and TCP network services running on the targeted hosts.
•	Recognize filtering systems between the user and the targeted hosts.
•	Determine the operating systems (OSs) in use by assessing IP responses.
•	Evaluate the target host's TCP sequence number predictability to determine sequence prediction attack and TCP spoofing.
