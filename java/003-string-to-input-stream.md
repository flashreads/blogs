# Convert String to InputStream in Java

Very often, especially when writing tests, you need to pass an `InputStream ` and
you want to read the data from a `String`.

To convert to input stream, the easiest way is first to convert the string to 
array of bytes, then read from the bytes using `ByteArrayInputStream`.

Here is an one-liner on how to do that in Java:

```java

InputStream stream = new ByteArrayInputStream("my-data".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

```
