# Java 7 vs Java 8


## First, let us learn what is Java 7 and Java 8 and its features:

### What is Java 7 and its features?
Java 7 (codename “Dolphin”) was the first major update to the Java programming language under the ownership and stewardship of Oracle since it acquired Sun Microsystems. The launch of Java SE 7 was an affirmation of Oracle’s commitment to the language and technology. It was a big achievement for the tech giant’s two-year ownership of Sun Microsystems – the company that created Java programming language. The Java 7 release was solid which offers some major upgrades including major bug fixes and improved support for non-Java dynamic languages, plus type interference support for generic class creation.


### Main features of Java 7 include:
1. Language enhancements grouped under a Project Coin
2. String object in a switch statement
3. Multiple exceptions handling to eliminate duplication of codes
4. Upgraded class-loader architecture
5. Improved type interference for generic instance
6. Library support for ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) algorithms
7. Upgraded Rowset 1.1 and JDBC 4.1
8. Improved Managed Beans
9. Automatic resource management in try-statement
10. Concurrency and collections updates
11. Compressed 64-bit pointers
12. JVM support for dynamically-typed languages


### What is Java 8 and its features?
Java SE 8 (codename “Spider”) is a revolutionary release of the development platform which brings some major tweaks and upgrades to the Java programming language including an enhanced JavaScript engine, new APIs for a date, and time manipulation, improved and faster JVM, and more. Java SE 8 is a giant leap forward for the programming language which also brings the tech giant’s most anticipated upgrade – the lambda expressions. It’s a new language feature exclusively added in the Java 8 update and which is touted as one of the most significant upgrades to the programming language. The lambda expressions are by far the biggest update to the model which is likely to increase productivity in many business models.


### Major features of Java 8 include:
1. Language-level support for Lambda Expressions
2. Interface Default and Static Methods
3. Unsigned Integer Arithmetic
4. Concurrent API enhancements
5. New Date and Time API
6. Parallel Sorting
7. Null Reference Template
8. New JavaScript Engine, Nashorn
9. New and improved Stream API
10. Removal of permanent generation


## So in short the difference between Java 7 and Java 8 is as follows:
1. Java SE 7 was code-named Dolphin and the code name for Java SE 8 is Spider.
2. Java 7 is supported on Win XP whereas Java 8 is not officially supported on Win XP.
3. Java 7 brings JVM support for dynamically-typed languages plus Type Interference for Generic Instance creation.
Java 8 brings the most anticipated feature for the programming language called Lambda Expressions, a new language feature that allows users to code local functions as method arguments.
4. Users can catch multiple exception types in one catch block which could be impossible before JDK 7.
Java 8 brings its new specialized API for Date and Time manipulation.

## Conclusion:
 Java 7 was a significant upgrade to the Java model which accommodates some major upgrades to the programming language including language enhancements, multiple exceptions handling, JVM support for dynamically-typed languages, and more. With Java 8, the programming language brings along its anticipated feature called the Lambda Expressions which changed the entire coding paradigm for the Java platform.
