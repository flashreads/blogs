# A simple Guide to FTP connection 
 
FTP
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

The client can send FTP commands such as STAT, PWD, RETR, and STOR. The ftplib module has multiple methods that can wrap these commands.

#Example

Create a send_command.py script and write the following content in it:

    import os
    import ftplib

    ftp_host='xxx'
    ftp_user_name='xxx'
    ftp_password='xxx'

    session = ftplib.FTP(ftp_host,ftp_user_name,ftp_password)
    # file to send
    file = open('origin_filename.txt','rb')
    # send the file
    session.storbinary('STOR 'end_filename.txt', file)

    # close file and FTP
    file.close()
    session.quit()

Run the script as follows:

    python3 send_command.py
