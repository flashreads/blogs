# Python and Libraries

Python along with so many libraries is a powerful language. These libraries not only help in doing complex and specific tasks but also trivial tasks which would have taken multiple lines of code.

One such library is numpy. This library offers a lot of mathematical functions to solve complex mathematical problems. But not only that, it also helps in doing simple tasks like reversing an array easily. 

```py
import numpy
num = input()
numlist = list(num)
numlistr = numpy.flipud(numlist)
```

The above code will reserve the array numlist.
