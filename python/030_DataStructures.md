## Basic data structures:
Python has four basic structure namely Lists,Dictionary,Tuple and sets.
These data structures are in built that come along with python and we also have user defined data structure.


## List:
Lists are the type of container which can store data of different types in the memory.Lists are created using '[]'(square braces)
Example:
```python
l1=[34,56,78,'list',(2,3)]
```
## Sets:
Sets are again similar to lists and tuples but diffrence would be it does not store duplicate values.It is enclosed in curly braces{}
Example:
```python
s1={2,45,(4.5,7),s}
```
## Tuple:
Tuple is similar to Lists but the diffrence is tuples are immutable where lists are mutable.Tuples are created using round braces()
Example:
```python
t1=(1,2,3,(67,78),'tuple')
```
## Dictionary:
Okay now dictionary are not at all like lists. These data structures store key-value pair. Take an anology of a dictionary where there is a word and a meaning to that. Dictionaries in python are created using curly braces.
Example:
```python
d1={1:a,2:b,3:c}
```
Some of the user defined data structures are as follows:
## Array: 
These data structures are similar to lists but it is homogeneous that is the elements having same datatype.

## Linked list:
These are the data structure that holds the value of next element using pointers.

## Stack:
These data structure follow the principle of last in first out. Basically, we can access only the last entered value. We can also do operations like push or pop.

## Queue:
These are the data structures that work following the principle of first in first out. You totally relate it to a queue in real life.

## Hash maps:
Hash maps are same as dictionaries in python.

## Graph:
Graphs stores the data in the collection of points called vertices and edges.
