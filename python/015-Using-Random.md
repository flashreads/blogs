## What is random?

Random is a python package that comes pre-installed when you install Python. It is a way to generate pseudo-random numbers that can be used in many different ways.

## Making our virtual die

First off, we need to import the package like so:

```python
import random
```

Since a normal die has six sides we want to pick a random number 1-6. We can do that like so:

```python
import random

result = random.randint(1, 6)
```

`random.randint(1,6)` chooses 1-6 at random and stores it in our variable I called `result`.

Now we want to print our result to the console. We can do that by typing this:

```python
import random

result = random.randint(1, 6)

print(f'You rolled a {result}!')

input("Press enter to continue...")
```

I now have added a way to print our result and I put the variable in an f-string so that I can add my value inside the string. I also added an input to prevent the console from closing immediately after running and a way to exit the program.

Thats it! You now have a virtual die!
