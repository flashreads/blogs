# Linux 

An operating system is the software that runs your computer, handling all
interactions between you and the hardware. Whether you’re writing a letter,
calculating a budget, or managing your recipes on your computer, the
operating system provides the essential air that your computer breathes.
Furthermore, an operating system isn’t just one program; it consists of hundreds of smaller programs and utilities that allow us humans to use a computer to do something useful. You then run other programs (such as your
word processor) on top of the operating system to get everything done.
Linux has been accused of being “just another operating system.” On the surface, it may appear so, but if you look deeper, you can see that this isn’t so.
The Linux project is a flagship leading the current trend toward open-source
and free (as in “freedom,” not “free beer”) software within the computing
industry. A rock-solid operating system because of the model under which it
was (and continues to be) developed, Linux represents much that is good in
software development.

# Getting Acquainted with Linux 11
Two fundamental distinctions separate Linux from the rest of the operatingsystem pack:
 ✓ Linux is licensed under the unique and ingenious GNU General Public
License, which you can read about in the next section.
 ✓ Linux is developed and maintained by a worldwide team of volunteer
and paid programmers working together over the Internet.
Linux is great for many reasons, including the fact that the folks who built it
from the ground up wanted it to be all the following:
 ✓ Multiuser: More than one user can be logged in to a single computer at
one time.
 ✓ Multiprocesser: True pre-emptive multitasking enables the operating system’s core to efficiently juggle several programs running at once. This is
important for providing multiple services on one computer.
 ✓ Multiplatform: Linux currently runs on more than 24 platforms (hardware types), including 32- and 64-bit Intel-based PCs, Digital/Compaq
Alpha, all variants of the Apple Macintosh, Sun SPARC, the Apple iPod,
and even the Microsoft Xbox.
 ✓ Interoperable: Linux plays nice with most network protocols (languages) and operating systems, allowing you to interact with users
and computers running Microsoft Windows, UNIX, Novell NetWare,
Macintosh computers, and other groups that occupy smaller market
niches.
 ✓ Scalable: As your computing needs grow, you can rely on Linux to grow
with you. The same Linux operating system can run on a tiny electronic
photo frame, a desktop computer, or a very large, industrial-strength
server system.
 ✓ Portable: Linux is mostly written in the C programming language. C is
a language created specifically for writing operating-system-level software and can be readily ported (translated) to run on new computer
hardware.
 ✓ Flexible: You can configure the Linux operating system as a network
host, router, graphical workstation, office productivity PC, home entertainment computer, file server, Web server, cluster, or just about any
other computing appliance you can think of.
12 Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet
 ✓ Stable: The Linux kernel (the heart of the operating system) has
achieved a level of maturity that makes most software developers
envious. It’s not uncommon to hear reports of Linux servers running
for years without crashing.
 ✓ Efficient: The modular design of Linux enables you to include only the
components needed to run your desired services. Even older Pentium
computers can utilize Linux and become useful again.
 ✓ Free!: To most people, the most intriguing aspect of Linux is the fact
that it’s often available free of charge. How (the capitalists murmur) can
anyone build a better mousetrap with no incentive of direct monetary
return?
