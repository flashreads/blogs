# LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM INTRODUCTION 

Linux includes a great many facilities and capabilities, so after you get past
the initial installation and configuration, you probably want to use your
system to do something. Here’s where the doing begins! 

We Find how to use Internet tools like Web browsers (Firefox!),
e-mail, instant messaging, and more.

Then you discover how to edit text files,
and then go whole hog with word processors and other office suite programs
thanks to OpenOffice.org.  The fun stuff is in this part too, like how to use
audio and video in the Linux world, and how to access software and formats
that you’re told are only available to Windows users

## EVOLUTION OF LINUX
An operating system is the software that runs your computer, handling all
interactions between you and the hardware. Whether you’re writing a letter,
calculating a budget, or managing your recipes on your computer, the
operating system provides the essential air that your computer breathes.

Furthermore, an operating system isn’t just one program; it consists of 
hundreds of smaller programs and utilities that allow us humans to use a 
computer to do something useful. You then run other programs (such as your
word processor) on top of the operating system to get everything done.

Linux has been accused of being “just another operating system.” On the surface,
it may appear so, but if you look deeper, you can see that this isn’t so.
The Linux project is a flagship leading the current trend toward open-source
and free (as in “freedom,” not “free beer”) software within the computing
industry. A rock-solid operating system because of the model under which it
was (and continues to be) developed, Linux represents much that is good in
software development
