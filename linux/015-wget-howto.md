# wget
Wget is a tool for downloading files from the Internet. It supports HTTP, HTTPS and FTP protocols.
It is flexible, so it could be use in background, in scripts, automation.

## wget usage

Syntax is simple:
```
$ wget [options] [URL]
```
And it could be used without any options:
```
$ wget [options] https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.14.12.tar.xz
```
Specify downloaded file name 
```
$ wget -O [filename] [options] [URL]
```
Example:
```
$ wget -O linux.tar.xz https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.14.12.tar.xz
```
Select download destination	
```
$ wget -P [path] [options] [URL]
```
To define download speed use "--rate-limit" construction:
```
$ wget --rate-limit [speed value] [options] [URL]
```
And example with 1 mbps speed limit:
```
$ wget --rate-limit 1m https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.14.12.tar.xz
```
Continue download. Wget is good with downloading via unstable connections, so use "-c" for continue downloading after interruption:
```
$ wget -c [options] [URL]
```
Background download:
```
$ wget -b [options] [URL]
```
Ignore certificate during HTTPS download:
```
$ wget --no-check-certificate [URL]
```
FTP download is possible too:
```
$ wget  --ftp-user=[username] --ftp-password=[password] [FTP URL]

Network-scripts Config File
There are two ways you can edit the network interface configurations in Linux:

GUI environment
Command-line
Both REHL (and CentOS) and Ubuntu both contain graphical utilities for editing these configuration files. Those graphical utilities will be accessed in a different way depending on which graphical interface you are using.
